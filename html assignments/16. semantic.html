            <h2>Dog</h2>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
                Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct gray wolves,and the gray wolf is the
                dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
                Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before
                the development of agriculture.</p>

            <h2>Cat</h2>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated
                species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
                domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet
                and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for
                companionship and its ability to kill vermin. </p>
